# V Implementation: The Nuts and Bolts

This chapter is dedicated to providing an in-depth look at the various framework features.  It covers concepts such as caching, data access, error handling, metrics reporting and more.  These features should be well understood by developers using the framework.  Where applicable, this chapter will explain the technology used for each feature, how it is configured, and why it exists.  If there were multiple technology options available, a description of the evaluation and pro's and con's of each candidate are examined, simply for the reader's edification.

This chapter can also serve as a reference point to specific areas of the framework in case developers need to learn more about a particular feature.
